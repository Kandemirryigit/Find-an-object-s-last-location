-The final project looks like this.

<h1>How Works?</h1>
-The main idea of the project:We have an object and at the begining this object doesn't have any coordinate.Firstly we should determine this object's coordinates.Then we should determine our object's x and y coordinate speeds.And we shouldn't forget we have gravity.It means the gravity is going to pull our object.Then we should determine the time and after that we can know our object's certain coordinates.So I can know in that time where is my object.So if I define my time 5 seconds the result is going to tell me your object is in this coordinates in 5.second.
